<h3> <a class="sites" href="https://www.puppyfind.com/">Puppyfind.com</a></h3>
<p>
    I recommend puppyfind.com as the top dog searching site. 
    Puppyfind.com is different from petfinder.com, so please 
    don't confuse the two. Although don't get me wrong petfinder.com 
    is a great pet rescue site. Puppyfind.com is a great site, because  
    it practically has zero scams.

<h3> <a class="sites" href="https://www.hoobly.com/">Hoobly.com</a> </h3>
<p>
    Hoobly.com is probably the second best dog searching site. It does have 
    more scams a bit more scams than puppyfind.com, unfortunately you can't be 
    completely free from scams. It does require you to register with them to
    be able to contact someone, but it is free.

<h3> <a class="sites" href="https://craigslist.org/">Craigslist.com</a> </h3>
<p>
    Craigslist.com is an a good site if you are on a low budget. The downside
    of Craigslist.com is that there are a lot of scams, but most of the scams
    are pretty easy to spot. You first go under community and then you will see pets.
